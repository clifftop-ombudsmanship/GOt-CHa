            Kryptonite is just a simple name for Trivikrama’s input with three repositories, one (GOt-CHa) of which is public.
            My only purpose so far with it is the achievement of standardization for workability.
            I may do more with it eventually, but for now I'm trying to develop a couple distinctions with these repositories toward my qualification of metadata with Idempotent Schema.

            Decades of chemical processing has been restoring mere chaos from evil, now goodness from that chaos.
            In the depths of evil, many years ago, my own style of fated professionalism being more that of the lonely brāhmaṇa as compared to the kṣatriya fate of Blue Öyster Cult’s Eric Bloom, I was “raised by wolves,” though more precisely: a geist, a mummy, and a promethean (Frankenstein his self, for all I know).
            I'm given to believe that in my earliest years, some type of subtly, the fumigant naphthalene started the process as a way to rid me of some of the spiritual bugs infesting our family’s vicinity, followed in my teen years by the (again, subtly) alchemical use of mercury.

            Once I was able to begin working my own purification process as a teenager and then adult, I started using LSD in the real world to save the beginnings of my soul from said family.
            I've come to believe that the LSD usage that went on for some years brought me square into the multiversality of Danny Rolling (Jack the Ripper) and Ted Bundy (Dracula), though I was still far from knowing that much of the truth of my own surroundings.
            I was approaching the initialization of my own universe as its Agni / Brahmā, where Gainesville’s Danny Rolling had been the Vedic Vṛtra of said myth, Vṛtra being the position held in this universe by the Indra of the adjacent universe, and vice versa.

            Salvation more properly began for me as I learned to quit searching for illegal drugs like LSD, and adopted the legal dissociative psychedelic dextromethorphan (DXM) as my drug of choice.
            Through more than a full decade of steady and frequent use of DXM, I learned that it is the fabled “nectar of immortality,” and I was in my consumer habit actually cleansing this universe of the likes of vampires, toward my becoming a more self-employing quality of citizen here.
            I found Lucifer (actor Al Pacino) and the Vedic Rāvaṇa (Robert De Niro) to be the next level of identity crisis associates, and have slowly regained my sense of purity in working with the identities of Michael and the Vedic Rāma.

            After that first decade of this new millennium, I was even resolving what anti-social tendencies I had carried up to that level of ascension work, and could live with an even more normal style of drug usage: I became a mere alcoholic.
            I did indulge a severe habit of drinking large amounts of 100 proof vodka daily, for too many years, but in the designs of my lifelong recovery from its alchemical burial beneath ascensive conscience, this helped me overcome some of the magical clouds that had hidden from me the more natural truths embodied by the god Pan (Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Anthony Kiedis) and the Catholic Saint Francis in his modern incarnation as Die Antwoord’s Watkin Tudor Jones.
            I became more legitimately sane, even if now in very poor health.

          <div style="text-align: justify">
            The process is a few steps away from being very complete, but the quitting of alcohol was a major adjustment.
            Caffeine is now the drug of choice.
            I'm recognizing these patterns better than I ever did, though I was for many years now seeing steady improvement in my “vision.”

            Each step seems to have an essential type of role reversal that is built upon the backbone of the design itself.
            The universe has inward versions of its celestial bodies, the the whole arrangement is hierarchical, meaning a level (moons, or planets, for example) is linked to the next level (planets, or stars).
            The system inward body (Earth’s moon inward of Earth, Venus inward of our Sun, this arm of our Milky Way Galaxy inward of Sagittarius A* at the core, etc.) is significant to the human, whereas the system upward body is that core of its lower system but in outer orbit around the core of the system above it.

            The geist of my family, my birth father his self, then, would be an Andromedan Galaxy link toward the Virgoan Supergalactic core of this supercluster of galaxies.
            Frankenstein (the promethean adoptive father) represented the Triangulum Galaxy inward of the Andromedan core of our Local Group of Galaxies, and “mummy” might have been some version of Milky Way.
            Dracula (Ted) was Sagittarius A* the vampire, while Danny the Ripper was system inward at the stellar level.

            Rāvaṇa is a Solar personality, and Lucifer is the Venusian human inward of our Sun.
            Pan and Zef (Saint Francis) have to do with inter-lunar relativity, Anthony Kiedis being the system upward personality and Ninja (Watkin) plays a system inward role closer to our own type of masculinity.
            Where the geist-promethean duality had been dependent upon wisdom for its “cooperativities,” immortality is elven, Rāma is famous for his protection of humanity, and Pan and Francis are very noteworthy for their animations.

            I somehow survived my family, and I somehow grew up out of the fear that Florida, and specifically Gainesville, might have suffered in the wake of Ted and Danny.
            It was right at the turning point for me, from LSD to DXM, when I saw Al Pacino’s famous <i>The Devil’s Advocate</i>, but unwittingly I just proceeded on with my own psychonautical journey.
            I had numerous visions of Robert De Niro toward the end of those years, just beginning to recognize who those two men are.

            Now I've found the story of Pan and Zef, and am looking foward to milder chemical adjustments and above.
            Caffeine, supposedly, restores the proper relationship between a soloist and a leader in the context of melodic musicality, Carrie Fisher, Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker together resembling that scenario.
            Above that, red and green kryptonite (which chemically is magnesium, a milder psychoactive than caffeine) are flavors in the mix of life, the elven rings Nenya and Narya restore elemental integrity in connection with the psychoactive chemical water itself.
