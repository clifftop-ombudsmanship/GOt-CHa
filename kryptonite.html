            Kryptonite is just a simple name for Trivikrama’s input with three repositories, one (GOt-CHa) of which is public.
            My only purpose so far with it is the achievement of standardization for workability.
            I may do more with it eventually, but for now I'm trying to develop a couple distinctions with these repositories toward my qualification of metadata with Idempotent Schema.

            Decades of chemical processing has been restoring mere chaos from evil, now goodness from that chaos.
            In the depths of evil, many years ago, my own style of fated professionalism being more that of the lonely brāhmaṇa as compared to the kṣatriya fate of Blue Öyster Cult’s Eric Bloom, I was “raised by wolves,” though more precisely: a geist, a mummy, and a promethean (Frankenstein his self, for all I know).
            I'm given to believe that in my earliest years, some type of subtly, the fumigant naphthalene started the process as a way to rid me of some of the spiritual bugs infesting our family’s vicinity, followed in my teen years by the (again, subtly) alchemical use of mercury.

            Once I was able to begin working my own purification process as a teenager and then adult, I started using LSD in the real world to save the beginnings of my soul from said family.
            I've come to believe that the LSD usage that went on for some years brought me square into the world of Danny Rolling (Jack the Ripper) and Ted Bundy (Dracula), though I was still far from knowing that much of the truth of my own surroundings.
            I was approaching the initialization of my own universe as its Agni / Brahmā, where Gainesville’s Danny Rolling had been the Vedic Vṛtra of said myth, Vṛtra being the position held in this universe by the Indra of the adjacent universe, and vice versa.
