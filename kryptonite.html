            Kryptonite is just a simple name for Trivikrama’s input with three repositories, one (GOt-CHa) of which is public.
            My only purpose so far with it is the achievement of standardization for workability.
            I may do more with it eventually, but for now I'm trying to develop a couple distinctions with these repositories toward my qualification of metadata with Idempotent Schema.

            Decades of chemical processing has been restoring mere chaos from evil, now goodness from that chaos.
            In the depths of evil, many years ago, my own style of fated professionalism being more that of the lonely brāhmaṇa as compared to the kṣatriya fate of Blue Öyster Cult’s Eric Bloom, I was “raised by wolves,” though more precisely: a geist, a mummy, and a promethean (Frankenstein his self, for all I know).
            I'm given to believe that in my earliest years, some type of subtly, the fumigant naphthalene started the process as a way to rid me of some of the spiritual bugs infesting our family’s vicinity, followed in my teen years by the (again, subtly) alchemical use of mercury.

            Once I was able to begin working my own purification process as a teenager and then adult, I started using LSD in the real world to save the beginnings of my soul from said family.
            I've come to believe that the LSD usage that went on for some years brought me square into the multiversality of Danny Rolling (Jack the Ripper) and Ted Bundy (Dracula), though I was still far from knowing that much of the truth of my own surroundings.
            I was approaching the initialization of my own universe as its Agni / Brahmā, where Gainesville’s Danny Rolling had been the Vedic Vṛtra of said myth, Vṛtra being the position held in this universe by the Indra of the adjacent universe, and vice versa.

            Salvation more properly began for me as I learned to quit searching for illegal drugs like LSD, and adopted the legal dissociative psychedelic dextromethorphan (DXM) as my drug of choice.
            Through more than a full decade of steady and frequent use of DXM, I learned that it is the fabled “nectar of immortality,” and I was in my consumer habit actually cleansing this universe of the likes of vampires, toward my becoming a more self-employing quality of citizen here.
            I found Lucifer (actor Al Pacino) and the Vedic Rāvaṇa (Robert De Niro) to be the next level of identity crisis associates, and have slowly regained my sense of purity in working with the identities of Michael and the Vedic Rāma.

            After that first decade of this new millennium, I was even resolving what anti-social tendencies I had carried up to that level of ascension work, and could live with an even more normal style of drug usage: I became a mere alcoholic.
            I did indulge a severe habit of drinking large amounts of 100 proof vodka daily, for too many years, but in the designs of my lifelong recovery from its alchemical burial beneath ascensive conscience, this helped me overcome some of the magical clouds that had hidden from me the more natural truths embodied by the god Pan (Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Anthony Kiedis) and the Catholic Saint Francis in his modern incarnation as Die Antwoord’s Watkin Tudor Jones.
            I became more legitimately sane, even if now in very poor health.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            The process is a few steps away from being very complete, but the quitting of alcohol was a major adjustment.
            Caffeine is a much better drug of choice, even supposedly helpful in relation to the threat of cancer that often goes with extended alcohol use.
            I'm recognizing the patterns in my life better than I ever did, though I was for many years, now, seeing steady improvement in my “vision.”

            Each step seems to have an essential type of role reversal that is built upon the backbone of the design itself.
            The universe has inward versions of its celestial bodies, and the whole arrangement is hierarchical, meaning a level (moons, or planets, for example) is linked to the next level (planets, or stars).
            The system inward body (Earth’s moon inward of Earth, Venus inward of our Sun, this arm of our Milky Way Galaxy inward of Sagittarius A* at the core, etc.) is significant to the human, whereas the system upward body is that core of its lower system but in an orbital arm of the system above it.

          <div style="text-align: justify">
            The geist of my family, my birth father his self, then, would be an Andromedan Galaxy link toward the Virgoan Supergalactic core of this supercluster of galaxies.
            Frankenstein (the promethean adoptive father) represented the Triangulum Galaxy inward of the Andromedan core of our Local Group of Galaxies, and “mummy” might have been some version of Milky Way.
            Dracula (Ted) was Sagittarius A* the vampire, while Danny the Ripper was system inward at the interstellar level.

            Rāvaṇa is a Solar personality, and Lucifer is the Venusian human inward of our Sun.
            Pan and Zef (Saint Francis) have to do with inter-lunar relativity; Anthony Kiedis is the system upward personality and Ninja (Watkin) plays a system inward role closer to our own type of masculinity.
            Where the geist-promethean duality had been dependent upon wisdom for its “cooperativities,” immortality is elven, Rāma is famous for his protection of humanity, and Pan and Francis are very noteworthy for their animations.

            I somehow survived my family, and I somehow grew up out of that fear which Florida, and specifically Gainesville, might have suffered in the wake of Ted and Danny.
            It was later, right at the turning point for me from LSD to DXM, when I saw Al Pacino’s famous <i>The Devil’s Advocate</i>, but unwittingly I just proceeded on with my own psychonautical journey.
            I had numerous visions of Robert De Niro toward the end of those years, just beginning to recognize who those two men are.

          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Now I've found the story of Pan and Zef, and am looking foward to milder chemical adjustments and above.
            Caffeine, supposedly, restores the proper relationship between a soloist and a leader in the context of melodic musicality; Carrie Fisher, Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker together resemble that scenario.
            Above this, in my own mythological interest, red and green kryptonite (which chemically is magnesium, a milder psychoactive than caffeine) are flavors in the mix of life, and the elven rings Nenya and Narya restore elemental integrity in connection with the psychoactive chemical water itself.

          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            The last step in my vision of the process ahead so far is the duality between Unitarian Universalism’s flaming chalice and the Happy Human.
            This completes the ascension to a high level of qualification, where the flaming chalice is the late-Piscean American adjustment of (Galadriel) Mary Magdalene’s cross for her (Gandalf) Jesus, he now in this environment being better suited as the Happy Human, or the Agni (flame) within all that chemistry which the chalice represents.
            Amen.

            Electronic media is real close to what chemistry is, and I'm trying to work with the development of some qualitative metadata in the “soul” for the wiki biographing I'm looking forward to with Wikia (now FANDOM), and maybe even, if I clean up my professionalism enough, Wikipedia.
            I'm designing a backbone for the system inward aspects of this story, and planning to color it some with references to World of Darkness’ <i>Mummy</i>, <i>Promethean</i>, <i>Hunter</i>, and <i>Demon</i>, maybe even some <i>Beast</i>, <i>Changeling</i>, and <i>Deviant</i>.
            The orthotic framework of system upward connectivity might include <i>Beast</i>, <i>Mummy</i>, <i>Changeling</i>, and <i>Deviant</i>, as well as <i>Wraith</i>, <i>Vampire</i>, <i>Werewolf</i>, and <i>Mage</i>.

          <div style="text-align: justify">
            I don't know, yet, how much of that type of thematic element I'll include or elaborate with, but the idea has been interesting me.
            I am very sure of my purpose with the exploration of truths in this new environment of ours.
            The population has certainly grown tremendously in recent centuries, and many souls are now sharing the same visible dimension who might have enjoyed their own worlds in previous lives.
            Peace on Earth will likely be achieved in a fashion that includes learning how to co-exist with some lifestyles that we had not in earlier times thought significant to our own possessed realms.

          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Idempotent Schema maps <i>Changeling</i>, <i>Promethean-Wraith</i>, and <i>Mummy</i> at the sacrococcygeal level of the spine, <i>Demon</i>, <i>Werewolf</i>, and <i>Deviant</i> at the thoracolumbar level above it.
            <i>Hunter</i> and <i>Vampire</i> are lumbosacrally right in between, and <i>Beast</i> is partially (primordially) below the whole structure, partially (magically) above it, in that case with WoD <i>Mage</i>.
            We'll see where this all goes.

            I've been experimenting with and learning Git, using a few different version control Git-repository hosting services.
            My very first encounter with Git was GitHub, when I was researching conceptual modeling and semantic metadata registration.
            The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) had GitHub repositories, and I just wandered into the environment wondering what it is.

          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Then, as I investigated further, I found GitLab, and Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps, and finally Git itself.
            Now I'm being creative in a way that allows me to use a combination of tools and sites, which I really like.
            Referata is another hosting service I'm using, my favorite wiki ever, and it will be my interface to reconnect with FANDOM, which is what I was using before I stepped into the world of metadata and version control.

          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            I appreciate some different aspects of each of these sites I've mentioned, and so have a number of working styles going on.
            I'm going to use Azure DevOps for some more private work with the name Zuoken in connection with the name Geshtai, both of which are <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> Product Identities and therefore unavailable for my public use.
            However, GitHub has a great deal with its offering of Pages, and so I will maintain a few public Pages with my repositories, “GOt-CHa” being the public partner to my private “Geshtai.”
